Welcome to the course! This class is designed to help you learn how to communicate effectively with AI tools such as **ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot**—a skill that is becoming essential across many fields.

You may already be using AI for writing, studying, brainstorming, or problem-solving. In this course, you will move beyond casual use and learn **how to guide these tools intentionally**. We focus on **intelligent prompting**: writing clear, structured instructions that help AI produce useful, accurate, and appropriate responses.

This is an **interdisciplinary course**, which means students from **all majors** are welcome. Whether you are studying engineering, business, health sciences, social sciences, arts, or another field, you will learn how AI can support your academic and professional work. You will practice prompting through hands-on activities, real-world examples, and interactive modules inside this app.

Throughout the course, we emphasize **critical thinking and responsible AI use**. AI can be a powerful assistant, but it also has limitations. You will learn how to evaluate AI responses, recognize potential errors or bias, and use these tools ethically and transparently.

By the end of the course, you will develop your own **personal prompting practice**—one that helps you think more clearly, communicate more effectively, and collaborate responsibly with AI systems.

st.markdown("""
This interdisciplinary course introduces students to the art and science of intelligent prompting—the skill of communicating effectively with large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot.

Through hands-on practice, interactive modules, and real-world scenarios, students from all majors and experience levels learn how to design clear, effective prompts for creative tasks, analytical reasoning, multimodal inputs, data interpretation, and discipline-specific applications.

The course emphasizes critical thinking, ethical awareness, and responsible human-AI collaboration. Students explore how generative AI can support education, research, healthcare communication, engineering reasoning, design workflows, business decisions, social science inquiry, media production, and more. By the end of the course, students develop a personal prompting practice grounded in clarity, reliability, and interdisciplinary relevance.

Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:

1. Explain how generative AI and large language models interpret instructions and produce responses in ways that support learning, creativity, and problem-solving across disciplines.  
2. Design structured prompts and multi-step prompting workflows for creative, analytical, multimodal, and data-rich tasks relevant to academic and professional settings.  
3. Apply prompting techniques within their own major or field of interest, using discipline-specific reasoning, terminology, and authentic scenarios.  
4. Evaluate AI-generated content for accuracy, bias, ethical concerns, hallucinations, usefulness, reliability, and disciplinary appropriateness.  
5. Use AI to improve communication, including writing, explanation, reasoning, brainstorming, and organizing information for different audiences and purposes.  
6. Develop a responsible, transparent, and ethical prompting practice that incorporates verification, critical thinking, and awareness of social and professional implications.
