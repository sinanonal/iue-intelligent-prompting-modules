## 1. Introduction: Entering the Era of Intelligent Assistance
We are entering a period where AI tools can support everyday tasks like drafting, summarizing,
planning, and idea generation. The key skill is learning how to communicate your intent clearly.

**Guiding questions**
- What tasks does AI help with most?
- Where does it fail or hallucinate?
- What is your responsibility as the user?
""",
    "2. What Is a Large Language Model?": """
## 2. What Is a Large Language Model?
A large language model predicts likely next words based on patterns learned from data.
It can produce fluent text, but it does not “know” facts in the way humans do.

**Guiding questions**
- Why can it sound confident even when wrong?
- What does “training data” mean at a high level?
""",
    "3. Capabilities and Limitations": """
## 3. Capabilities and Limitations
LLMs can be great at drafting, organizing, and generating alternatives.
They are weaker when you need verified facts, citations, or exact calculations without checking.

**User habit**
- Ask for assumptions
- Ask for a checklist
- Verify key claims
